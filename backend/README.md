## Getting started

![Backend CI](https://github.com/tryyang2001/CS3213-Frontend-Management-System/actions/workflows/Backend_CI.yml/badge.svg)

This folder is intended to contain all the backend related microservices such as authentication, user, grading services, etc.

When working on this folder, ensure you have created a folder for the microservice. Eg:

```
backend
    auth
        <start your work here...>
    user
    grading
    ...
```
