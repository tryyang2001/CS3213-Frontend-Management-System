# Helper Code from external sources

1. `/src/types/HttpStatusCode.ts`, retrieved from [here](https://gist.github.com/scokmen/f813c904ef79022e84ab2409574d1b45). This is helpful for indicating the meaning of each HTTP status code, without the need to set up all possible code.
2. `/src/components/ui`, any components inside this directory is generated from shadcn-ui, which is a UI library for constructing highly customizable components.
